# Mapesa App

## Project description

We are building a web platform that can enable users to register and send money to each other within the system. They top up their accounts through MPESA* and can now transfer amongst themselves. They use the registered number or email address to transfer.  The platform should have a friendly landing page and signup process. The users will use the application mostly on their phones so it should work well on a mobile browser as well as desktop

## Challenge

The challenge was to build an application using a reactive framework/tools like Angular that consumes API from a backend such as Firebase. The frontend should help persist data to the backend and should have friendly UI and UX. You may use API mocking tools such as apiary instead of persistent datastore like firebase

#### Tools used
- React.js
